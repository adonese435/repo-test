first we have to get to the directory that we want to make by cd ~/github-learning
i have to create a new directory using mkdir
then i have to make the new directory into a working directory by cd
have to make our current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository by git init
touch README.md to create a new README file 
then put c9 README.md to open the new README file
you have to then type something in it and save
then include git add README.md which adds our new file to the staging area
then we add git commit -m "this is test repo" which makes our first commit using the README file
click the repository button
then i used the command git remote add origin
then i put in git push -u origin master
git push to push the changes
